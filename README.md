Adafruit-Flora-Pixel-Library
============================

This Arduino library supports our original "V1" Flora Pixels ONLY. You can spot these by the small IC chip on the back of the board.

For all newer products -- "V2" Flora Pixels (no IC chip on the back), NeoPixel Stick, Flex Strip, etc. -- use the Adafruit_NeoPixel library:
